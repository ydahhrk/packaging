4. `debian/control`: Vcs-Git should include -b:

   Vcs-* fields are for packaging. There is not issue to
   share upstream Git for that, but this means you should have some
   branch dedicated for Debian packaging (like "debian") who is based on
   the tag you are currently packaging (and when you update the upstream
   version, you merge master in this branch). Then, you can point
   Vcs-Browser to the branch, as well as Vcs-Git (with "-b debian")

   See the policy manual.
